    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerouns was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enought tugorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably more.

        <p>
          Known for his dazzling charm, repier wit and unrivaled humanity, Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="https://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> intorductory sequence. Michael is also notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com">Tau Day</a> and author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-releted Learn English Tutorials.

        <p>
          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
